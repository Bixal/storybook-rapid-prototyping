# Creating pages

We'll re-use our components to create a landing page with more realistic looking content.

A base template has already been setup. We only need to import the components we want to use.

1. Add the hero to the `landing.html.twig` template in the commented section for hero.

   ```html
   {# Hero #} {% include "@components/hero/hero.html.twig" %} {# /Hero #}
   ```

   You should see the default hero appear.

1. Next, add the card component to the news section. Replace the `News card group` text with an include for the card component.

   ```html
   {% include "@components/card/cards.html.twig" %}
   ```

1. Include the following components for each section.

   ```html
   {# News #}
   <section id="news">
     <h2>Latest news</h2>
     {% include "@components/card/cards.html.twig" %}
   </section>
   ```

   ```html
   {# Callouts #}
   <section id="callouts">
     {% include "@components/card/cards.html.twig" %}
   </section>
   ```

   ```html
   {# Latest blog posts #}
   <section id="latest-blogs">
     <h3>Latest blog posts</h3>
     {% include "@components/collection/collection.html.twig" %}
   </section>
   ```

   ```html
   {# Events #}
   <section id="upcoming-events" class="tablet-lg:margin-top-8">
     <h3>Upcoming events</h3>
     {% include "@components/collection/collection.html.twig" %}
   </section>
   ```

   Only the hero will render because we don't have any content available for the other components. Let's fix that by re-using stories.

1. Open `landing.stories.js` and import Cards and Collection stories. At the top of the page add the following:

   ```js
   // landing.stories.js
   import * as Cards from "../../components/card/card.stories";
   import * as Collection from "../../components/collection/collection.stories";
   ```

1. In our const Default add args for the page sections: hero, news, callouts, blogs, and events.

   ```js
   export const Default = {
     args: {
       hero: "",
       news: "",
       callouts: "",
       blogs: "",
       events: "",
     },
   };
   ```

1. We can add custom data, but for now we want to connect it to their story defaults. You can pass that data like so:

   ```js
   export const Default = {
     args: {
       hero: "",
       news: Cards.default.args,
       callouts: Cards.default.args,
       blogs: Collection.default.args,
       events: Collection.default.args,
     },
   };
   ```

1. Connect these data sources to the components in `landing.html.twig`.

   ```html
   {# News #}
   <section id="news">
     <h2>Latest news</h2>
     {% include "@components/card/cards.html.twig" with news %}
   </section>
   ```

   ```html
   {# Callouts #}
   <section id="callouts">
     {% include "@components/card/cards.html.twig" with callouts %}
   </section>
   ```

   ```html
   {# Latest blog posts #}
   <section id="callouts">
     {% include "@components/collection/collection.html.twig" with blogs %}
   </section>
   ```

   ```html
   {# Events #}
   <section id="upcoming-events" class="tablet-lg:margin-top-8">
     <h3>Upcoming events</h3>
     {% include "@components/collection/collection.html.twig" with events %}
   </section>
   ```

1. Components are now rendering, but they're the same. Let's re-use storybook variants in the **Latest News** and **Events** section.

   ```js
   export const Default = {
     args: {
       ...
       news: Cards.Flag.args,
       ...
       events: Collection.Date.args,
     },
   };
   ```

   You'll see the correct variants for these sections. USA Card flag for news and Collection Date for events.
