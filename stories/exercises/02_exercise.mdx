# 02. Creating a dynamic component

Visit the Button story docs, you'll see that there isn't anything we can pass to this component to prototype or re-use in other contexts.

We're going to make a dynamic component from a static twig template. Let's add some StorybookJS args to make this component take a variant and custom text.

1. Open `./stories/components/button/button.stories.js`.
1. Let's add args to make this customizable. In `args` object add two new args for `variant` and `label`.
   ```js
   // button.stories.js
   export default {
     ...
     args: {
       variant: "",
       label: "Button"
     },
   }
   ```
1. Visit the button docs and you'll see a table that documents these new settings.
1. To verify that these work, change the Controls. Modify the button label to some custom text or use the USA Button [docs](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/button/) as a reference to add a new variant, like `outline`.
1. When you refresh these settings will reset.
1. We can go further by creating a variant.
1. Create a new `const` for USA Button Outline variant.
   ```js
   // button.stories.js
   export const Outline = {};
   ```
1. Override the variant arg to use `outline` as the default.
   ```js
   // button.stories.js
   export const Outline = {
     args: {
       variant: "outline",
     },
   };
   ```
1. We've got a new variant and now you can see the component docs have been updated too.
