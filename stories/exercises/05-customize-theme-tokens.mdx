# 05. Customize with theme tokens

With content on our landing page, we're going to make sweeping changes using USWDS Design Tokens and theme settings.

You can view the available theme settings by visiting the [USWDS Settings Table](https://designsystem.digital.gov/documentation/settings/#general-settings-2).

Lets start by updating some of our [theme color tokens](https://designsystem.digital.gov/documentation/settings/#color-settings-2). USWDS theme color tokens are designed to be useful and effective for small and large projects.

1. Pick a color palette and copy SCSS variables.

  <h2>Colors</h2>
  <h3>Earth tones</h3>
  <ColorPalette>
    <ColorItem
      title="Base"
      subtitle="Base colors"
      colors={{
        'yellow-5v': '#fff5c2',
        'yellow-10': '#f5e6af',
        'yellow-30v': '#ddaa01',
        'yellow-80v': '#422d19',
      }}
    />
    <ColorItem
      title="Primary"
      colors={{
        'green-warm-60v': '#5a6613',
        'green-warm-70v': '#4b4e10',
      }}
    />
    <ColorItem
      title="Accent"
      colors={{
        'gold-30v': '#e5a000',
      }}
    />
  </ColorPalette>

  Theme setting values

  ```scss
  $theme-color-primary: "green-warm-60v",
  $theme-color-primary-dark: "green-warm-70v",
  $theme-color-primary-darker: "green-warm-80v",
  $theme-color-base-lightest: "yellow-5v",
  $theme-color-base-lighter: "yellow-10",
  $theme-color-base-light: "yellow-30v",
  $theme-color-base-darkest: "yellow-80v",
  $theme-color-accent-cool: "gold-30v",
  ```

  <h3>Oceanic</h3>
  <ColorPalette>
    <ColorItem
      title="Base"
      subtitle="Base colors"
      colors={{
        'blue-cool-5': '#e7f2f5',
        'blue-cool-10': '#dae9ee',
        'blue-cool-30': '#82b4c9',
        'blue-cool-80': '#14333d',
      }}
    />
    <ColorItem
      title="Primary"
      colors={{
        'cyan-60': '#2a646d',
        'cyan-70v': '#0e4f5c',
      }}
    />
    <ColorItem
      title="Accent"
      colors={{
        'mint-cool-30': '#6fbab3',
      }}
    />
  </ColorPalette>

  Theme setting values
`
  ```scss
  $theme-color-primary: "cyan-60",
  $theme-color-primary-dark: "cyan-70v",
  $theme-color-primary-darker: "cyan-80v",
  $theme-color-base-lightest: "blue-cool-5",
  $theme-color-base-lighter: "blue-cool-10",
  $theme-color-base-light: "blue-cool-30",
  $theme-color-base-darkest: "blue-cool-80",
  $theme-color-accent-cool: "mint-cool-30",
  ```

2. Visit `uswds-theme.scss`.
2. Uncomment the `@use 'uswds-core with (...)` section and paste the theme settings from the chosen palette between the parenthesis.
    ```scss
    @use "uswds-core" with (
      Theme color settings go here
    );
    ```
4. Save and allow storybook to rebuild. Visit the landing page and view your new theme!
4. To showcase additional theme settings that we have available, lets update our heavy font weight and increase our border radiuses.
    ```scss
    $theme-font-weight-bold: 900,

    $theme-border-radius-sm: 1,
    $theme-border-radius-md: 2,
    $theme-border-radius-lg: 3,
    ```
6. Refresh the page and we'll see our hero heading with the increased font weights, and our rounded margins are increased throughout our components.

    If you take a look at the search input within our header, you might have noticed the imbalanced border radius. Since our button border radius is not used on the input, we'll have to update manually. To showcase another great USWDS tool, lets add a utility class to our `input` element.

7. Visit the [border utility](https://designsystem.digital.gov/utilities/border/) page
7. In the "examples and usage" section, find the find the class that utilizes the **`md` token for the left border radius**.
7. Open `/stories/components/header/header.html.twig`.
7. Add the class to the `usa-input` input element tag.
7. View the header and you'll see the border radius now matches the button! Since we updated the `md` border radius value, the change will be reflected _everywhere_ the `md` border radius is used!

Now that we know how to use theme settings, lets take a look at component settings in exercise 6.
