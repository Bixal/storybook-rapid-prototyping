# 03. Composite components

Sometimes you need to create a component that relies on other components. You can re-use components and data easily with storybook.

Like the previous exercise, we'll make the hero component more dynamic. We'll also add our more dynamic button. The template has already been setup. Let's add args for: aria label, heading, body text, and a call to action.

We've already documented our component variables in `hero.html.twig:5`. Let's add those as args in storybook to make it dynamic.

1. Open `/stories/components/hero/hero.stories.js`.
1. In `args` add the following settings.
   ```js
   export default {
    ...
    args: {
      aria_label: "",
      heading_alt: "",
      heading: "",
      body: "",
      cta: "",
    },
   }
   ```
1. You should see the settings table in your Story. Now we can modify the content in real time.
1. Let's modify the CTA so that it re-uses our button component. Open `/stories/components/hero/hero.html.twig:27`.
1. Replace the CTA string with a twig include for the button component. Use the `@components` shorthand for easier pathing. _These shorthands were setup in `vite.config.js`_
   ```html
   {% include "@components/button/button.html.twig" %}
   ```
1. Our button is now included, but it's not dynamic. We can fix that with a few changes.
1. Open `hero.stories.js` and change `cta`'s value from a string to an object that takes a `label` and `variant`.

```js
  cta: {
    label: "Hero CTA",
    variant: "",
  },
```

1. We can use our hero cta to modify button by passing the object in the twig include.

```html
{% include "@components/button/button.html.twig" with cta %}
```
