# 01. Adding USWDS Components

We're going to go to the USWDS website and grab USA Banner markup for all of our page templates.

1. Go to [USWDS Banner component](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/banner/).
1. Expand the component code accordion.
1. Copy markup and paste into `./stories/components/banner/banner.html.twig`.
1. Remove extra markup so that you're left with a **single** Banner variant.
1. Update image paths from `./assets/img` â†’ `./img`. <i>This will use the images from the USWDS node package.</i>

1. Add the component to your base template. Our vite config allows us to reference components with a namespace shorthand.
1. Include this static component with a twig include:

   ```html
   <!-- base.html.twig -->
   {% include "@components/banner/banner.html.twig" %}
   ```

   Now all of our page templates will have banner!
