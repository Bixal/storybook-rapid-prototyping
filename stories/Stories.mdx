# Creating stories

Stories don't require much to setup. You'll need: a folder, a template, and a `.stories.js` file.

```zsh
./stories/commponents/header
├── header.html.twig
└── header.stories.js
```

Basic composition of stories requires importing the story, defining the component, and a default.

```js
import Header from "./header.html.twig";

// Basics of a story.
export default {
  title: "Components/Header",
  args: {}, // Define controls to make your stories more dynamic.
  component: Header, // Attach the twig template.
};

// The variant that'll render in storybook.
export const Default = {};
```
